                I am an anthropologist, author and PhD student whose research has primarily focused on the history of human space exploration and tech ethics. Recently, my debut non-fiction book, Ground Control: An Argument for the End of Human Space Exploration was released via Chicago Review Press. It asks, should we go? Is it worth it to send humans to space? What cultural outcomes will result from continued human space exploration and the colonization of other worlds? And lastly, what can we learn about our present selves by studying our most extreme visions of the future? 
                I’m currently working on two other forthcoming projects. The first, based on my doctoral dissertation, is a history of asteroid mining and its legalization. The second, is a history of how apocalypse has been used to accomplish political goals throughout time.
                When I’m not writing, I love to play Magic The Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons, love to work in my local ceramics studio, and visit coffee shops and craft breweries.
